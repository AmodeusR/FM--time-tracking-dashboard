### Built with

- Flexbox
- React
- Sass

### What I learned

Since this was my first solo project with React – after the projects of video classes – I've learned plenty of things about it! I specially tried to apply a file structure to keep things very organized, which was a novel to me as well.

There isn't a great challenge on using React here, but that was the intention, since if I got something too hard I wouldn't be able to focus on solidifying the basics. But I added some challenges, like dinamically generating the card components, which the most challenge was creating its different background colors dinamically.

### Useful resources

I based the files structure from [This tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HNyXCPDQ7Q), which shows a great way of organizing everything, in my opinion.
